# Data-Structures

#### Practice for coding custom basic well known data structures and their associated algorithms in C++. The following data structures are implemented with possible missing features:

+ Singly linked list
 + Can be constructed from another `SinglyLinkedList` or from an `std::initializer_list` of the proper type
 + Find
 + Append (another list or an element)
 + Reverse
 + Insert after
