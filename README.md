# Data-Structures

#### Practice for coding custom basic well known data structures and their associated algorithms in C++. The following data structures are implemented with possible missing features:

+ Singly linked list
 + Can be constructed from another `SinglyLinkedList` or from an `initializer_list` of the proper type.
 + Supports the following operations:
  + Find
  + Append (another list or an element)
